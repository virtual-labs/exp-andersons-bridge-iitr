### Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AC bridges are often used to measure the value of unknown impedance (self/mutual inductance of inductors or capacitance of capacitors accurately). A large number of AC bridges are available and Anderson's Bridge is an AC bridge used to measure self inductance of the coil. It is a modification of Wheatstones Bridge. It enables us to measure the inductance of a coil using capacitor and resistors and does not require repeated balancing of the bridge.The connections are shown in Fig: 1.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bridge is balanced by a steady current by replacing the headphone H by moving coil galvanometer and AC source by a battery. This is done by adjusting the variable resistance, r. After a steady balance has been obtained, inductive balance is obtained by using the A.C source and headphone.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The condition for balance is that the potentials at the terminals D and E are same. Then the current flowing through branch AB is I<sub>1</sub>, through branch AE and EB is I<sub>2</sub>. The current flowing through branches AD and DC is I<sub>3</sub>, while that through branch BC is I<sub>1</sub>+I<sub>2</sub>. No current flows through branch DE.<br>

### Note:
1.  Since the impedances of the arms should be of the same order of magnitude, the approximate value of L should be determined by some other method.
2.  Sometimes it may be impossible to obtain the balance by varying r and S. Then the formula for L with a value of RQ which satisfies formula for S may require negative value of r. If the product  CR<sub>q</sub> is greater than L, then variable resistance r will be a negative quantity. It will, therefore, not possible to obtain a balance point under such conditions. Hence it is desirable to know the value of L approximately so that CRQ is less than L. A balance is then obtained with a positive value of r.  The value of P and R should be then be adjusted  so that r is a positive quantity and a balance can be obtained by varying the value of r. To obtain balance point a cathode ray oscilloscope can be used in place of heat phone.

### Advantages:
1.  Fixed capacitor is used in terms of variable capacitor.
2.  The bridge is used for accurate determination of inductance in millimeter range.

### Disadvantages:
1.  Bridge is more complex
2.  Difficult to attain balancing condition.
